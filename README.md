# In-Memory-DBMS-using-Trees
This project implements a simple, memory-based Database Management System (DBMS) using tree data structures. The system provides functionality to create and manage tables in memory, where each table stores records. It is entirely non-persistentâ€”data is stored in memory during runtime, and no file storage is required.
